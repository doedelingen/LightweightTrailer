# LightweightTrailer

The aim of this project is to create a lightweight trailer that I can pull with my wife's car (2020 Suburu Forester Limited) and we can take on road trips across country. This repository is intended as a place for me to jot down ideas and updates to the project as I go through it. It's also intended to allow someone else to follow in my footsteps, especially to follow the resources I used to learn what I needed.

If not all goals can be met, the top ones are to be prioritized (AKA no point if I can't tow it, can't afford it, can't sleep in it).

Project Goals:
  1. Tow weight less than 2500 lbs (Subaru Forester)
    a) incorrect, in the US it only has a 1500lb capacity. Around 3000lbs in europe/australia).
  2. Total cost less than $5000
  3. Full or Queen size bed
  4. Room to stand, a sink, and a toilet
  5. There needs to be at least a door between the bed and the toilet
     a) The more seperation the better

Stretch Goals:
  a) Cost less than $2000
  b) Able to boondock at least a week
  c) Weigh less than 1400 lbs (my 2013 Nissan Altima)
    i. Weigh less than 750 lbs (doesn't require registration in Utah, other states may have different rules)

Notes:
  Will need tail/brake lights, reflectors, safety chains, plate light, and possibly other trailer-specific things

Current tools:
  CAD:
    OnShape - "Currently free" CAD, easy to learn (easier than open source systems) and close-ish to SolidWorks or AutoDesk (which helps add to my resume)
  Simulation:
    PreProMax - Free and open source, probably can't do dynamic analysis, only static or frequency response.
      Chain link tutorial, part of series - https://youtu.be/pEktnro0G0k?si=FsQMkIChQEtsE_7a
      More complex imported geometery, simpler analysis - https://youtu.be/9ttKiVSeVDQ?si=WURypRI6-oGTfwBH
    SolidWorks - "Premium" license(?) - my boss gave me permission to use a company license in my free time, claims it can do "static and dynamic, but not fluids," will be interesting to see if it can do fatigue or vibration data
